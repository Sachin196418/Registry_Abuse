# Registry_Abuse

Registry_Abuse is a research and demonstration repository focused on identifying, analyzing, and exploiting common Windows Registry abuse techniques. These techniques are often leveraged by attackers and red teamers to maintain persistence, evade defenses, or escalate privileges on Windows systems.
üîç Overview

The Windows Registry is a powerful subsystem, and its flexibility makes it a prime target for abuse. This repository highlights various ways the registry can be manipulated for:

    Persistence mechanisms

    Privilege escalation

    Defense evasion

    Information hiding

    Execution of malicious payloads

This project is intended for security researchers, penetration testers, red teamers, and defenders looking to better understand offensive and defensive tactics involving the Windows Registry.
